# PORTABLE-AIR-QUALITY-MONTORING-SYSTEM
This project deals with measuring Air Quality using MQ135 sensor along with Carbon Monoxide CO using MQ7 sensor. Measuring Air Quality is an important element for bringing lot of awareness in the people to take care of the future generations a healthier life. Based on this, Government of India has already taken certain measures to ban ‘Single Stroke’ and ‘Two Stroke’ Engine based motorcycles which are emitting high pollution comparatively. We are trying to implement the same system using IoT platforms like Thingspeak or Cayenne, we can bring awareness to every individual about the harm we are doing to our environment. Already, New Delhi is remarked as the most polluted city in the world recording Air Quality above 300 PPM. We have used the easiest platform like Thingspeak and set the dashboard to the public such that everyone can come to know the Air Quality at the location where the system is installed. Also, we have reduced the cost of components used on comparing with the papers referred. Index Terms—IoT, MQ135, MQ7, PM2.5 Thingspeak.
